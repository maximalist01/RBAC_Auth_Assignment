<h1> **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Authentication, Authorization Project**</h1>

**Overview**
The above project implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) along with Authentication and Authorization mechanisms. It ensures that only authorized users with specific roles can access certain routes or perform specific actions, which is a critical aspect of application security.I have tried my best to deliver results as expected. 

**Key Concepts**

*Authentication*:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. In this project, users must log in with valid credentials (e.g., username and password) to obtain a token that proves their identity.

*Authorization*:
Authorization ensures an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access certain resources. In this project, users are assigned roles (e.g., admin, user), and each role has specific permissions that define their actions.

*Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)*:
RBAC is a system of managing users' access based on their roles. Each role is associated with permissions to access particular resources or perform certain actions. For example:

-  Admins have full access.
-  Users have limited access to certain routes.

**Technologies Used**

 -- Node.js: For the backend server

 -- Express: For routing and middleware

 -- MongoDB: For user data storage

 -- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For authentication and managing sessions

 -- bcrypt: For password hashing

**Here are setup instructions to get started**

Prerequisites:
Node.js installed
MongoDB running (used locally)

1. Clone the Repository:

2. Install Dependencies:

   *npm install*
   
    In both frontend and backend folders.

3. Set Up Environment Variables:
   Create a .env file with,

   *PORT=4000*

   *MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/rolebasedauth*

   *JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key*


4. Run the Application:

   To start the server, run:

   *npm run dev (frontend)*
   *node server.js  (backend)*

The server will start on http://localhost:4000.

**API Endpoints**

1. *POST /login*

   Description: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.

   **Input**:

    Body: { "username": "user1", "password": "password123" }

   **Output**:

     On Success: { "token": "jwt_token_here" }

     On Failure: { "message": "Invalid credentials" }

2. *POST /register*

    Description: Registers a new user and assigns a default role (e.g., "user").

  **Input**:

    Body: { "username": "user2", "password": "password123", "role": "user", "email": "email1" }

  **Output**:

    On Success: { "message": "User registered successfully" }

    On Failure: { "message": "Username already exists" }"

3. *GET /admin*

    Description: Accesses an admin-only route.

    Authorization: Requires the user to be an admin.

   **Input**:

     Headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer jwt_token_here" }

   **Output**:

     On Success: { "message": "Welcome Admin" }

     On Failure: { "message": "Access Denied: Admins only" }

**Role-Based Access Management**

   Middleware is used to verify the user's role before allowing access to manage RBAC for routes. 


**Conclusion**

  This project demonstrates how to implement robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) along with Authentication and Authorization using JWT, ensuring that users only access resources they're authorized to. By applying proper security measures, such as password hashing, token-based authentication, and role checks, the system ensures that sensitive routes and data are protected based on the user's role.
